# Language Compiler

This repository contains the BNFC grammar and generated parser for a custom programming language.

## Grammar Specification

### Lexical Units

- **Identifiers**  
  A letter followed by letters or digits (e.g., `myVar1`).  
- **Integers**  
  One or more digits (e.g., `42`).  
- **Strings**  
  Doubleâ€‘quoted (`"..."`), with escapes: `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\f`.  
- **Comments**  
  Start with `!` and run to end of line.

### Reserved Words

These cannot be used as identifiers:
```
program, if, then, else, while, do, read, write, begin, end, array
```

### Operators & Delimiters

All appear inline in the grammar:

- **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- **Assignment:** `=`  
- **Grouping:** `(`, `)`  
- **Statement end:** `;`  
- **List sep:** `,`  
- **Blocks:** `begin`, `end`
